["Within quasi-solid thermocells composed of a 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel and a 0.4 M ferro/ferricyanide (K₄Fe(CN)₆/K₃Fe(CN)₆) solution, the introduction of an ordered, hierarchical, and aligned nanochannel architecture enables the simultaneous and significant enhancement of macroscopic mechanical properties (e.g., toughness, fatigue resistance) and electrochemical performance (e.g., ionic conductivity), thereby addressing the key bottlenecks of conventional thermocells in wearable applications."]
