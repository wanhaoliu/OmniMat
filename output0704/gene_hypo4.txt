Please act as a meticulous Data Librarian. Your sole task is to categorize the list of provided key points, which constitute a single, existing scientific hypothesis.

[Core Research Question to provide context]
['How can the architecture of quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes be engineered to enhance ionic conductivity, leading to improved thermoelectric and mechanical performance in high-performance thermal batteries?']

[Key Points of the Hypothesis to Categorize]
['###Chemical Key Points###\n1. **Poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) Matrix**  \n   Role and Function: The poly(ionic liquid) serves as the foundational polymer matrix due to its inherent ionic conductivity. The chemical modification with sulfate (—SO₃⁻) functional groups enhances solubility and ionic transport by creating ionic motifs that facilitate the movement of ions through the polymer network. This modification is crucial for improving ionic conductivity, which directly addresses the scientific question of enhancing ionic conductivity in quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes.\n\n2. **Electrospinning and Ice-Templating Techniques**  \n   Role and Function: The combination of electrospinning and ice-templating is employed to fabricate a hierarchical structure characterized by aligned nanochannels and fibrillar architectures. Electrospinning generates aligned polymer fibers, while ice-templating creates uniform nanochannels that significantly reduce tortuosity, thereby enhancing ionic conductivity. This structural engineering is essential for improving the thermoelectric and mechanical performance of the polymer electrolytes, as it facilitates efficient ionic transport.\n\n3. **Ferro/Ferricyanide Redox Couple**  \n   Role and Function: The integration of the ferro/ferricyanide redox couple into the polymer matrix enhances electrochemical performance by providing a mechanism for redox reactions that can improve ionic transport and overall conductivity. The optimization of its concentration (1-3 mol/L) during the gelation phase ensures a homogeneous distribution, which is critical for maintaining mechanical stability while enhancing the ionic conductivity necessary for high-performance thermal batteries.\n\n4. **Mechanical Training Regimen**  \n   Role and Function: The bespoke mechanical training regimen, involving cyclic stretching at 20-30% strain, is designed to improve the fatigue resistance and mechanical properties of the structured polymer electrolyte. This process aligns polymer chains and enhances inter-fibrillar interactions, which contribute to the overall toughness and elasticity of the material. Improved mechanical performance is vital for the durability and longevity of the polymer electrolytes in operational conditions.\n\n5. **Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)**  \n   Role and Function: EIS is utilized to quantify ionic conductivity across a range of temperatures (20-80 °C) and to assess the performance of the polymer electrolyte. By focusing on obtaining Nyquist plots, this method provides critical data on the ionic transport properties, which are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of the engineered polymer in enhancing ionic conductivity and thermoelectric performance.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###']

Please act as a highly precise Data Validation Specialist. Your task is to process a list of newly identified scientific components and filter out any that have already been evaluated, based on a comprehensive reference list. The comparison must be strictly controlled to only match items that are demonstrably the same entity. Your final output must be a Python list of novel items, enclosed in specific delimiters.

[Your Task and Step-by-Step Logic]

1.  **Focus on Chemicals and Techniques:** From the [Newly Identified Components to Process], extract only the items categorized under "Chemicals" and "Techniques". Ignore all other categories.

2.  **Perform Strict Comparison and Filtering:** For each extracted Chemical and Technique, you must determine if it has already been evaluated by comparing it against the single [Previously Evaluated Key Points List].

    *   **Strict Definition of "Same Item":** An item is considered "already evaluated" ONLY IF it is a **direct synonym, a common acronym, or a well-established alternative chemical name** for an item in the reference list. Your comparison must be conservative and precise, focusing on nomenclature rather than functional similarity.

    *   **Allowed Match Example (Nomenclature):** If the reference list contains "Poly(methyl methacrylate)", and a new item is "PMMA", they should be considered the same and filtered out because one is a standard acronym for the other.

3.  **Identify Novel, Unevaluated Items:** Create a final list that includes **only** the Chemicals and Techniques that do **not** meet the strict definition of being the same as any item in the [Previously Evaluated Key Points List].

4.  **Format the Final Output:**
    *   Present the final list of novel, unevaluated items as a single Python list of strings. Each string in the list should be a concise, descriptive phrase.
    *   Enclose the entire Python list within `###Final Output###` and `###End###` delimiters.
    *   If no new, unevaluated items are found, the output inside the delimiters should be an empty list `[]`.
    *   Your entire response must ONLY contain the delimited output block. Do not add any other text, explanation, or notes.
