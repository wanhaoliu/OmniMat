Please act as a meticulous Data Librarian. Your sole task is to categorize the list of provided key points, which constitute a single, existing scientific hypothesis.

[Core Research Question to provide context]
['How can the architecture of quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes be engineered to enhance ionic conductivity, leading to improved thermoelectric and mechanical performance in high-performance thermal batteries?']

[Key Points of the Hypothesis to Categorize]
["###Chemical Key Points###\n1. **Poly(Ionic Liquids) (PILs)**\n   Role and Function: The incorporation of poly(ionic liquids) into the polymer electrolyte system introduces sulfonate groups (—SO₃⁻) that enhance ionic transport. The presence of these ionic groups increases the mobility of ions within the polymer matrix, which is crucial for improving ionic conductivity. The chemical modification of the polymer backbone facilitates better ion dissociation and transport pathways, directly addressing the need for enhanced ionic conductivity in thermoelectric applications.\n\n2. **10% (w/v) Poly(Vinyl Alcohol) (PVA)**\n   Role and Function: PVA serves as a structural backbone for the polymer electrolyte, providing mechanical integrity and flexibility. The preparation of a 10% (w/v) PVA solution allows for the formation of a gel-like matrix that can host ionic species. The addition of lithium salts (0.2 M LiCl) further enhances ionic mobility, as lithium ions can easily migrate through the PVA matrix, contributing to the overall ionic conductivity and mechanical performance of the electrolyte.\n\n3. **Ammonium Sulfate (0.2 M)**\n   Role and Function: The salting-out process using ammonium sulfate induces phase separation in the PVA solution, leading to the formation of porous microstructures. This porosity is essential for creating a network that facilitates ionic transport, as it increases the surface area available for ion movement and enhances the overall conductivity of the polymer electrolyte.\n\n4. **N,N'-Methylenebisacrylamide (0.05 M)**\n   Role and Function: This crosslinking agent is used to create a robust interpenetrating network within the hybrid polymer system. The crosslinking process enhances the mechanical strength and stability of the polymer electrolyte, ensuring that the ionic pathways remain intact during operation. This structural integrity is vital for maintaining performance under mechanical stress and during thermal cycling in thermoelectric applications.\n\n5. **Ferro/Ferricyanide Redox Couple (1-3 mol/L)**\n   Role and Function: The incorporation of this redox couple during the gelation phase enhances the electrochemical performance of the polymer electrolyte. The redox reactions facilitated by ferro/ferricyanide improve charge transport and can contribute to the thermoelectric properties of the system by providing additional pathways for charge carriers, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of the thermoelectric cell.\n\n6. **Electrospinning Technique**\n   Role and Function: Electrospinning is employed to create aligned fibers that integrate into the polymer matrix, forming nanochannels that facilitate ionic transport. The alignment of fibers enhances the directional conductivity of the electrolyte, which is crucial for improving the thermoelectric performance. The resulting nanochannels provide a continuous pathway for ion movement, significantly boosting ionic conductivity.\n\n7. **Mechanical Training Procedure**\n   Role and Function: The cyclic stretching of the polymer electrolyte at strains of 20-30% for 500 cycles aligns the polymer chains and improves inter-fibrillar bonding. This mechanical training enhances the material's fatigue resistance and overall mechanical strength, which is essential for the durability and longevity of the thermoelectric devices in practical applications.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###"]
