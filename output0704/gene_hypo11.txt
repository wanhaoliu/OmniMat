Please act as a meticulous Data Librarian. Your sole task is to categorize the list of provided key points, which constitute a single, existing scientific hypothesis.

[Core Research Question to provide context]
['How can the architecture of quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes be engineered to enhance ionic conductivity, leading to improved thermoelectric and mechanical performance in high-performance thermal batteries?']

[Key Points of the Hypothesis to Categorize]
['###Chemical Key Points###\n1. **Poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) Matrix**  \n   Role and Function: The poly(ionic liquid) serves as the foundational polymer matrix due to its inherent ionic conductivity. The chemical modification with sulfate (—SO₃⁻) functional groups enhances solubility and ionic transport by creating ionic motifs that facilitate the movement of ions through the polymer network. This modification is crucial for improving ionic conductivity, which directly addresses the scientific question of enhancing ionic conductivity in quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes.\n\n2. **Electrospinning and Ice-Templating Techniques**  \n   Role and Function: The combination of electrospinning and ice-templating is employed to fabricate a hierarchical structure characterized by aligned nanochannels and fibrillar architectures. Electrospinning generates aligned polymer fibers, while ice-templating creates uniform nanochannels that significantly reduce tortuosity, thereby enhancing ionic conductivity. This structural engineering is essential for improving the thermoelectric and mechanical performance of the polymer electrolytes, as it facilitates efficient ionic transport.\n\n3. **Ferro/Ferricyanide Redox Couple**  \n   Role and Function: The integration of the ferro/ferricyanide redox couple into the polymer matrix enhances electrochemical performance by providing a mechanism for redox reactions that can improve ionic transport and overall conductivity. The optimization of its concentration (1-3 mol/L) during the gelation phase ensures a homogeneous distribution, which is critical for maintaining mechanical stability while enhancing the ionic conductivity necessary for high-performance thermal batteries.\n\n4. **Mechanical Training Regimen**  \n   Role and Function: The bespoke mechanical training regimen, involving cyclic stretching at 20-30% strain, is designed to improve the fatigue resistance and mechanical properties of the structured polymer electrolyte. This process aligns polymer chains and enhances inter-fibrillar interactions, which contribute to the overall toughness and elasticity of the material. Improved mechanical performance is vital for the durability and longevity of the polymer electrolytes in operational conditions.\n\n5. **Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)**  \n   Role and Function: EIS is utilized to quantify ionic conductivity across a range of temperatures (20-80 °C) and to assess the performance of the polymer electrolyte. By focusing on obtaining Nyquist plots, this method provides critical data on the ionic transport properties, which are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of the engineered polymer in enhancing ionic conductivity and thermoelectric performance.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###']

[Your Task and Step-by-Step Logic]

Your response must be structured into two parts: a "Scratchpad" for your thought process and a "Final Output" with the result.

**Part 1: Scratchpad (Your Thought Process)**

Before providing the final list, you must first work through your reasoning here. For each item in the [Candidate List of Chemicals and Techniques to Process], perform and document the following steps:

*   **Step A: Identify the Core Entity.**
    *   From the candidate item string, you must extract its **base component** or **core entity**. This means stripping away any parameters, concentrations, adjectives, or other modifiers.
    *   *Generic Example of Thought Process:*
        *   Candidate: "A 50mg dose of Acetaminophen"
        *   Core Entity Identified: "Acetaminophen"
        *   Candidate: "The novel 'X-Pulse' Sonication method"
        *   Core Entity Identified: "Sonication"

*   **Step B: Perform Strict Comparison of the Core Entity.**
    *   Take the extracted **core entity** and check if it has a semantic equivalent in the [Reference List of Evaluated Components].
    *   **Strict Definition of "Same Item":** An item is a match ONLY IF the core entity is a **direct synonym, a common acronym, or a well-established alternative name** for an item in the reference list.
    *   *Generic Example of Thought Process:*
        *   Reference List contains: "Paracetamol"
        *   Core Entity: "Acetaminophen"
        *   Comparison Result: MATCH.
        *   Decision: Filter out "A 50mg dose of Acetaminophen".

    *   *Generic Example of Thought Process:*
        *   Reference List contains: "Stirring"
        *   Core Entity: "Sonication"
        *   Comparison Result: NO MATCH.
        *   Decision: Keep the core entity "Sonication".

*   **Step C: Compile the Final List of Core Entities.**
    *   After evaluating all candidates, compile a list of the unique **Core Entities** that you decided to KEEP. If multiple candidates resolve to the same novel core entity (e.g., "1-3 M solution of X" and "5 M solution of X"), that core entity ("X") should appear only once in the final list.

**Part 2: Final Output**

After completing your analysis in the scratchpad, provide the final, compiled list of unique core entities in the specified format below. This part should contain ONLY the delimited output block.
