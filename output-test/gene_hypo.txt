    *   **C. Mechanisms/Principles:** The described physical or chemical processes, principles, or functional roles.
    *   **D. Parameters/Targets:** Specific numerical values, concentrations, conditions, or desired performance metrics mentioned.

2.  **Identifying "Decision Hubs":**
    This is the most critical step. Based on your categorization, identify the core choices a researcher must make when designing a single, coherent research project. These "Decision Hubs" are typically points where multiple, mutually exclusive options exist.

    *   Clearly state these hubs. For example: "In the 'Techniques' category, there are multiple distinct structure-forming methods (e.g., Technique X, Technique Y...). A researcher must select one as the primary path."
    *   Similarly, check the 'Chemicals' category for alternative base material systems.
