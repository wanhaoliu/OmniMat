            "We hypothesize that the integration of a dual crosslinked network composed of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), enhanced through a synergistic combination of salting-out techniques, will significantly enhance ionic conductivity while preserving mechanical integrity in quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes for high-performance thermoelectric applications. \n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Polymer Matrix Preparation:  \n   First, prepare a 10% (w/v) PEO solution dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at elevated temperature (60°C) for optimal solubility. Simultaneously, dissolve PVA in deionized water at 80°C to create a 10% (w/v) solution. Combining these two solutions in a 1:1 volumetric ratio will facilitate strong interchain interactions necessary for effective crosslinking.\n\n2. Ionic Conductive Additives:  \n   Introduce lithium salts (LiCl or LiI) to the mixed solution at a concentration of 0.2 M, ensuring complete dissolution to enhance ionic mobility. \n\n3. Salting-Out Treatment:  \n   Gradually incorporate ammonium sulfate as the salting-out agent at concentrations ranging from 0.1 M to 0.5 M while stirring. This will initiate phase separation and promote microstructural evolution, critical for forming a porous matrix.\n\n4. Dual Crosslinking Procedure:  \n   Following freeze-drying, immerse the resulting structure in a 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution for 12 hours to facilitate robust network formation. Optimize the polymer crosslinker ratio between 1:20 and 1:40 to balance ionic conductivity and mechanical properties effectively.\n\n5. Mechanical and Ionic Characterization:  \n   Evaluate the ionic conductivity using AC impedance spectroscopy over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz from 25°C to 80°C, identifying optimal conditions for ionic transport. Conduct tensile testing to document elongation, tensile strength, and toughness, targeting parameters of toughness exceeding 2,500 J/m² and elongation at break greater than 300%.\n\n6. Mechanistic Insights:  \n   We propose that the hierarchical porosity achieved through salting-out will substantially improve pathways for ionic transport, reducing tortuosity and enabling increased ionic mobility. Utilize dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to further elucidate the relationship between structural integrity and ionic performance across varying operational conditions.\n\nBy synthesizing these methodologies, this novel dual-crosslinked polymer electrolyte system aims to reveal new mechanisms of ionic conduction and mechanical resilience, showcasing significant advancement in the development of thermoelectric devices. Successful implementation will allow for broader applications in energy storage and other advanced functional materials, thus contributing significantly to the field of polymer science and materials engineering.",
