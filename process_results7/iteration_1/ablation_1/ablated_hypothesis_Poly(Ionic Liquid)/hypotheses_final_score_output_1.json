            "We hypothesize that engineering a tri-functional quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte characterized by a matrix, hierarchical micro/nano-scaled structures, and aligned ionic pathways via bionic mechanical training will unpredictably enhance both ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness. This will significantly improve thermoelectric performance in high-performance thermal batteries.\n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Material Selection and Modification:\n   - Utilize a polymer functionalized with sulfate groups to enhance ionic transport and mechanical integrity. The degree of functionalization will be controlled (≥50%) to optimize solubility and ionic conductivity.\n   - Introduce lithium salts (LiCl or LiI) and ferro/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)₆³⁻/⁴⁻) at concentrations of 0.2–0.4 M for ionic conduction, ensuring these additives are thoroughly dissolved and uniformly distributed.\n\n2.

Bionic Mechanical Training:\n   - The structured polymer will undergo cyclic mechanical training at a strain of 20% for 1000 cycles at a frequency of 1 Hz. This regimen is intended to align polymer chains and enhance inter-fibrillar connectivity reminiscent of biological systems, thereby improving toughness and elasticity.\n\n5. Controlled Freezing and Sublimation:\n   - Following preprocessing, the structured solution will be subject to controlled freezing (–20°C to –40°C) to facilitate anisotropic ice crystal growth. Subsequent freeze-drying at -60°C will remove the ice phase, resulting in a porous honeycomb structure embedded with ionic pathways.\n\n6. Cross-Linking:\n   - Enhance structural integrity and ionic pathway retention by cross-linking; submerge the freeze-dried polymer in a 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution for 12 hours, ensuring improved mechanical properties while maintaining ionic mobility.\n\n7. Characterization Techniques:\n   - Employ Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to assess microstructure and porosity, demonstrating honeycomb architecture; Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) will characterize mechanical properties.
