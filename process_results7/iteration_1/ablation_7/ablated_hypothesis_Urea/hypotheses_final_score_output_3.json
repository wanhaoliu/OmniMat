Its role is critical in providing mechanical support and flexibility, which are essential for the durability and performance of thermal batteries. The hydrogen bonding network within the PVA contributes to its mechanical properties, while its hydrophilic nature facilitates the solvation of ions, thereby enhancing ionic conductivity. The presence of PVA also allows for the formation of a stable gel-like structure that can accommodate the ordered nanochannel architecture, which is vital for improving ionic transport pathways.\n\n2. **0.4 M Ferro/Ferricyanide (K₄Fe(CN)₆/K₃Fe(CN)₆) Solution**  \n   Role and Function: The ferro/ferricyanide couple acts as a redox-active electrolyte that enhances ionic conductivity through its ability to undergo reversible redox reactions. The concentration of 0.4 M is optimized to ensure sufficient ion availability for conduction while maintaining the stability of the gel matrix. The presence of these ions increases the overall ionic mobility within the PVA hydrogel, which is crucial for improving the electrochemical performance of the thermocell.

            "We hypothesize that developing a dual-network quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte composed of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) with integrated tetraethylammonium fluoride (TEAF) will significantly enhance ionic conductivity and mechanical resilience. This enhancement will occur through the following mechanistic integrations:\n\n1. Material Synthesis:\n   - We will prepare a 10% (w/v) PVA solution in deionized water, incorporating lithium salts (LiCl or LiI) at 0.2 M to promote ionic solvation and mobility.\n   - Simultaneously, a 3 wt% PAA aqueous solution will be prepared and then layered upon the PVA solution using a co-casting method. The dual layering will encourage the formation of interpenetrating networks.\n\n2. Crosslinking for Stability and Conductivity:\n   - Utilizing N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide as a crosslinker, we will irradiate the PAA layer with UV light (254 nm for 10 minutes) to establish a robust chemically crosslinked network, which will enhance mechanical interlocking and ionic transport pathways, targeting a toughness exceeding 2500 J/m².\n   - The concentration of TEAF (5-15 wt%) will be optimized within this system to form ionic domains promoting dissociation and mobility of ions.\n\n3. Hierarchical and Structured Fabrication:\n   - We will employ freeze-casting techniques on the phase-separated PVA-PAA solution by subjecting it to controlled cooling at -30 °C, followed by freeze-drying to create a porous honeycomb architecture conducive to ionic transport. The freeze-drying process aims to yield a structured framework with low tortuosity path for ions.\n   - Aligned nanofibers created from a functionalized PIL solution via electrospinning will be integrated into the freeze-dried architecture after curing. The electrospinning parameters will be carefully controlled (18 kV, 15 cm distance) to maintain structural integrity.\n\n4. Mechanical Training:\n   - A post-fabrication cyclic mechanical training regimen will be applied, stretching the composite at 25% strain and 1 Hz frequency for 1000 cycles. This mechanical training regime is expected to improve molecular alignment and enhance the ionic transport pathways through structural modifications.\n\n5. Comprehensive Characterization:\n   - Ionic conductivity will be quantitatively assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz across varying temperatures. We aim to achieve a conductivity of ≥ 1 mS/cm under optimal conditions.\n   - Mechanical properties will be evaluated utilizing dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tensile testing according to ASTM D638 standards to ensure robustness in real-world applications.\n\n6. Sustained Operational Integrity:\n   - We will address potential environmental challenges such as moisture absorption by employing hydrophobic coating strategies on the final electrolyte device, thus enhancing durability and operational longevity.\n\nThis integrative approach aims to address the current limitations in quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes, combining structural design innovation with chemical advancements for high-performance thermoelectric applications.",
