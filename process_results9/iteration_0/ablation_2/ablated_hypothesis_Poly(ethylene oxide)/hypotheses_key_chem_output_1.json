Fabrication of Aligned Nanochannels via Electrospinning and Ice-Templating:\n   Employ electrospinning at an applied voltage of 15–20 kV, adjusting the needle-to-collector distance (8–15 cm) and the flow rate (0.5–1 mL/h) to ensure optimal fiber alignment. Follow with ice-templating, cooling the polymer solution at -2 °C/min to generate aligned nanochannels that facilitate low tortuosity pathways for ion transport.\n\n5. Dual Crosslinking Techniques:\n   Post-freeze-drying, treat the constructed polymer matrix with glutaraldehyde (1% v/v) for 12 hours to establish a robust crosslinked network. Optimize the crosslinker ratio between 1:20 and 1:40 based on tensile strength and ionic conductivity evaluations via standard ASTM D638 methods.\n\n6. Mechanical Training Protocol:\n   Subject the dual-crosslinked polymer electrolyte to a mechanical training regimen with cyclic stretching at 20-30% strain. Execute 1000 loading/unloading cycles at a frequency of 1 Hz to align the polymer chains and enhance inter-fibrillar networking, improving toughness and fatigue resistance.\n\n7.
