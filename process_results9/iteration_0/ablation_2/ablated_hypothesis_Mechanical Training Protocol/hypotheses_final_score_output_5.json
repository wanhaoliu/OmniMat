            "We hypothesize that engineering a dual crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte comprising poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), augmented by hierarchical structures of aligned nanochannels and fibrillar architectures via electrospinning and ice-templating, will markedly improve ionic conductivity and mechanical properties for high-performance thermoelectric battery applications.\n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Polymer Matrix Preparation:\n   Prepare a 10% (w/v) solution of PEO in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 60°C until fully dissolved. Simultaneously, dissolve a 10% (w/v) PVA solution in deionized water at 80°C. Upon achieving homogeneity, combine these solutions in a 1:1 volumetric ratio to facilitate strong interchain interactions for effective network formation.\n\n2. Incorporation of Ionic Conductive Additives:\n   Add lithium salts (LiCl or LiI) at varying ratios (0.1 M to 0.3 M), informed by prior work on ionic mobility. Use sonication for complete dissolution and uniform distribution, ensuring integration into the polymer matrix enhances ionic conductivity.\n\n3. Cold Salting-Out and Phase Separation Optimization:\n   Introduce ammonium sulfate as a salting-out agent at incremental concentrations of 0.1 M to 0.5 M while monitoring phase separation through dynamic light scattering (DLS). This step aims to achieve a microstructurally distinct polymer network with increased porosity, evaluated for its impact on ionic transport and overall electrolyte performance.\n\n4. Fabrication of Aligned Nanochannels via Electrospinning and Ice-Templating:\n   Employ electrospinning at an applied voltage of 15–20 kV, adjusting the needle-to-collector distance (8–15 cm) and the flow rate (0.5–1 mL/h) to ensure optimal fiber alignment. Follow with ice-templating, cooling the polymer solution at -2 °C/min to generate aligned nanochannels that facilitate low tortuosity pathways for ion transport.\n\n5. Dual Crosslinking Techniques:\n   Post-freeze-drying, treat the constructed polymer matrix with glutaraldehyde (1% v/v) for 12 hours to establish a robust crosslinked network. Optimize the crosslinker ratio between 1:20 and 1:40 based on tensile strength and ionic conductivity evaluations via standard ASTM D638 methods.\n\n6. Characterization of Ionic Conductivity and Mechanical Performance:\n   Employ AC impedance spectroscopy across temperatures (25°C to 80°C) to quantitate ionic conductivity with targeted values above 10⁻⁴ S/m. Perform tensile testing to measure mechanical properties, including tensile strength exceeding 1,200 kPa and toughness above 2,500 J/m², ensuring performance metrics align with established polymer standards.\n\nThis hypothesis aims to not only address the challenges of ionic conductivity and mechanical stability in polymer electrolytes but also to create a framework for integrating multifunctional properties into thermoelectric devices. By emphasizing specific methodologies, the work anticipates significant contributions to polymer science and energy applications, fostering innovation in thermoelectric technologies.",
