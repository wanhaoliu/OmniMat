            "We hypothesize that the synergistic development of a dual-architecture composed of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)—incorporated through an innovative framework of salting-out and electrospinning—will comprehensively enhance the ionic conductivity and mechanical performance of quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes for thermoelectric applications.\n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Material Preparation:  \n   - PVA Solution: Prepare a 10% (w/v) PVA solution by dissolving PVA in deionized water at 80 °C. Once cooled, integrate lithium salts (LiCl or LiI) at optimized concentrations of 0.2 M and 0.3 M, targeting maximum ionic conductivity and ensuring full solubilization to facilitate ion mobility.\n   - PIL Functionalization: Synthesize a functionalized PIL by reacting a commercially available PIL with sulfate groups (e.g., via sulfonation) to enhance ionic transport properties. The functionalization will include rigorous purification steps to maintain ionic integrity.\n\n2. Salting-Out Process:  \n   - Gradually introduce ammonium sulfate as a salting-out agent in concentrations of 0.2 M to 0.4 M into the PVA-ionic solution under continuous stirring, enabling induced phase separation without excessive precipitation. The salting-out will foster the creation of a microstructured network conducive to ionic pathways.\n\n3. Electrospinning:  \n   - Employ electrospinning to create aligned fibers from the functionalized PIL. Use a voltage of 18 kV, a needle-to-collector distance of 15 cm, and a feed rate adjusted to 0.5 mL/h to form fibrous networks which can be integrated with the freeze-cast structure post-drying.\n\n4. Crosslinking and Integration:  \n   - The dried composites will undergo a cross-linking process by immersion in a 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution for 12 hours. This cross-linking mechanism will enhance mechanical integrity while ensuring ionic continuity throughout the composite matrix, promoting optimal electrochemical performance.\n\n5. Mechanical Training:  \n   - Implement a cyclic mechanical training regimen, stretching the integrated structure at 25% strain, 1 Hz frequency for 1000 cycles. This training will improve inter-fibrillar strength and toughness through molecular alignment and networking.\n\n6. Comprehensive Characterization:  \n   - Employ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz to measure ionic conductivity, and correlate mechanical properties using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for detailed microstructural analysis, and tensile testing per ASTM D638 standards for quantifying mechanical performance.\n\n7.
