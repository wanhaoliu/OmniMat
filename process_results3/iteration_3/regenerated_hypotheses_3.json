Its role is critical in providing mechanical support and flexibility, which are essential for the durability and performance of thermal batteries. The hydrogen bonding within the PVA network contributes to its mechanical properties, while its hydrophilic nature facilitates the solvation of ions, enhancing ionic conductivity. The presence of PVA also allows for the formation of a stable gel-like structure that can accommodate the ordered nanochannel architecture, which is vital for improving ionic transport.\n\n2. **0.4 M Ferro/Ferricyanide (K\u2084Fe(CN)\u2086/K\u2083Fe(CN)\u2086) Solution**  \nRole and Function: The ferro/ferricyanide couple acts as a redox-active electrolyte within the polymer matrix. The concentration of 0.4 M is optimized to ensure sufficient ionic mobility and conductivity. The reversible redox reactions between the ferrocyanide and ferricyanide ions enhance the electrochemical performance by facilitating charge transfer processes. This contributes to improved ionic conductivity, which is essential for the overall efficiency of the thermoelectric system.
