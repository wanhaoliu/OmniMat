Its hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, which contribute to the overall strength of the polymer network. This structural support is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the electrolyte under operational conditions, while also allowing for ionic transport through its matrix. The presence of PVA enhances the mechanical performance of the electrolyte, which is essential for high-performance thermal batteries.\n\n2. **Poly(Ionic Liquids) (PILs) with Sulfonate Groups**  \nRole and Function: The incorporation of PILs with sulfonate groups significantly increases the density of ionic sites within the polymer matrix. These ionic liquids are known for their high ionic conductivity and ability to facilitate ion transport. The sulfonate groups enhance the solubility of the ionic liquid in the polymer matrix, promoting better ionic mobility. This increase in ionic site density directly addresses the need for improved ionic conductivity, which is a key requirement for enhancing the performance of thermal batteries.\n\n3. **Acrylamide**  \nRole and Function: Acrylamide acts as a non-traditional crosslinking agent that enhances the mechanical stability of the polymer network.
