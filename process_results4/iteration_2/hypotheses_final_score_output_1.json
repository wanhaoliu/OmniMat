Additionally, PVA's hydrophilic nature can interact with the ionic species, further promoting ionic transport and stability within the electrolyte system.\n\n3. **Ammonium Sulfate**\n   Role and Function: Ammonium sulfate is introduced to induce a porous microstructure within the polymer matrix. This phase separation creates voids that facilitate ionic transport, significantly enhancing the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. The porous structure allows for easier movement of ions, which is critical for improving the performance of thermal batteries.\n\n4. **Graphene Oxide (GO)**\n   Role and Function: Graphene oxide is integrated into the polymer system to improve both ionic transport and mechanical performance. Its high surface area and electrical conductivity provide additional pathways for ion movement, which can lead to enhanced ionic conductivity. Furthermore, GO can reinforce the mechanical properties of the polymer matrix, making it more robust under operational conditions.\n\n5. **N,N'-Methylenebisacrylamide**\n   Role and Function: This compound serves as a crosslinking agent that stabilizes the polymer network. By forming covalent bonds between polymer chains, it enhances the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the electrolyte. The crosslinked structure ensures that the polymer maintains its integrity while allowing for efficient ionic transport, which is crucial for the performance of thermal batteries.\n\n6. **Mechanical Training Procedure**\n   Role and Function: The Mechanical Training Procedure involves cyclically aligning the polymer chains under stress, which can enhance the mechanical properties of the polymer electrolyte. This alignment can also facilitate more effective ionic transport by reducing the entanglement of polymer chains, thereby optimizing the pathways available for ion movement.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###",
