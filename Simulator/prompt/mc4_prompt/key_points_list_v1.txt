[Instruction]
Please act as a highly precise Data Validation Specialist. Your task is to process a list of newly identified scientific components and filter out any that have already been evaluated, based on a comprehensive reference list. The comparison must be strictly controlled to only match items that are demonstrably the same entity. Your final output must be a Python list of novel items, enclosed in specific delimiters.

[Context]

1.  **Previously Evaluated Key Points List (Both essential and non-essential):**
    {previously_evaluated_key_points}

2.  **Newly Identified Components to Process:**
    {newly_identified_components}

[Your Task and Step-by-Step Logic]

1.  **Focus on Chemicals and Techniques:** From the [Newly Identified Components to Process], extract only the items categorized under "Chemicals" and "Techniques". Ignore all other categories.

2.  **Perform Strict Comparison and Filtering:** For each extracted Chemical and Technique, you must determine if it has already been evaluated by comparing it against the single [Previously Evaluated Key Points List].

    *   **Strict Definition of "Same Item":** An item is considered "already evaluated" ONLY IF it is a **direct synonym, a common acronym, or a well-established alternative chemical name** for an item in the reference list. Your comparison must be conservative and precise, focusing on nomenclature rather than functional similarity.

    *   **Allowed Match Example (Nomenclature):** If the reference list contains "Poly(methyl methacrylate)", and a new item is "PMMA", they should be considered the same and filtered out because one is a standard acronym for the other.

3.  **Identify Novel, Unevaluated Items:** Create a final list that includes **only** the Chemicals and Techniques that do **not** meet the strict definition of being the same as any item in the [Previously Evaluated Key Points List].

4.  **Format the Final Output:**
    *   Present the final list of novel, unevaluated items as a single Python list of strings. Each string in the list should be a concise, descriptive phrase.
    *   Enclose the entire Python list within `###Final Output###` and `###End###` delimiters.
    *   If no new, unevaluated items are found, the output inside the delimiters should be an empty list `[]`.
    *   Your entire response must ONLY contain the delimited output block. Do not add any other text, explanation, or notes.

[Example of Final Output Format]
###Final Output###
["Use a sturdy plastic bottle as the main structure.", "Incorporate a cotton wick for water transport.", "Add activated charcoal to prevent mold."]
###End###
