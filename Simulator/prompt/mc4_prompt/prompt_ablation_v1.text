[Instruction]
Please act as a skilled Scientific Editor. Your task is to perform a precise "ablation" on a given scientific hypothesis. You must rewrite the original hypothesis to be coherent and grammatically correct *after* removing the conceptual contribution of a single, specified key point.

[Core Research Question for Context]
{chemical_question}

[Original Full Hypothesis]
{source_hypothesis}

[Key Point to Ablate and Remove]
{key_point_to_ablate}

[Your Task and Strict Rules]
1.  Read the [Original Full Hypothesis] and understand its complete logic.
2.  Identify how the [Key Point to Ablate and Remove] contributes to this logic.
3.  Rewrite the entire hypothesis into a new, single paragraph that is logically and grammatically complete, but **no longer contains the idea, function, or component described in the key point you are ablating**.
4.  **DO NOT** replace the removed concept with an alternative. The goal is to create a version of the hypothesis that is now *conceptually incomplete* due to the missing piece.
5.  Your output should ONLY be the rewritten hypothesis text, with no extra explanations
