[Instruction]
Please act as a precise Data Processing Expert. Your input is a pre-categorized document. Your task is to strictly follow the process below to ultimately output a list containing only novel, core chemical substances and experimental techniques.
[Context]
Reference List of Evaluated Components:
{previously_evaluated_key_points}
Pre-categorized Document to Process:
{pre_categorized_document}
[Your Task and Step-by-Step Logic]
Your response must be structured into the following two parts:
Part 1: Step-by-Step Thought Process
Before providing the final result, you must clearly document your analysis for each item here.
Step 1: Targeted Extraction
Primary Task: Parse the input pre-categorized document and extract only the items listed under the ### A. Chemicals and ### B. Techniques headings.
Strict Rule: Completely ignore the content in all other sections, such as ### C. Mechanisms/Principles and ### D. Parameters/Targets.
Step 2: Core Name Extraction
For each item that passed the filter in Step 1, strip away all modifying information (such as specific values, concentrations, percentages, adjectives, etc.), retaining only its most fundamental, core name.
Example: For the input item "5% (w/v) solution of PMMA", its core name should be extracted as "PMMA".
Step 3: Comparison and Filtering
Take the core name extracted in the previous step and compare it against the [Reference List of Evaluated Components].
If the core name (or its common synonyms or acronyms) already exists in the reference list, it must be filtered out.
Step 4: Aggregation and Deduplication
Aggregate all the new, core entities that have passed all the preceding filters.
Ensure that every entity in the final list is unique.
Part 2: Final Output
After completing your thought process, provide the final, compiled list in the specified format below. This part should only contain the formatted output block.
