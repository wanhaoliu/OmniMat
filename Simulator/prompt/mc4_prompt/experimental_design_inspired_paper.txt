INSTRUCTION: Act as an Experimental Design Expert
The strategic direction is set. Now, in the capacity of an Experimental Design Expert, your task is to design a detailed and rigorous experimental validation protocol for the core hypothesis you just formulated, drawing upon all provided information.
YOUR TASK
Define Objectives & Hypothesis:
At the beginning of the protocol, clearly restate the core hypothesis you formulated and break it down into 1-3 specific, measurable research objectives.
Filter & Integrate Relevant Information:
Review all provided information. From the [Additional Reference Materials], you must select and integrate relevant methods, parameters, and techniques that support the testing of the Core Hypothesis. Extract only the specific details directly needed for this new protocol, ignoring all irrelevant information.
Crucial Constraint: You are strictly prohibited from introducing any new chemical substances or core processes from the reference materials if they are not explicitly part of the Core Hypothesis.
From the references, extract only the operational parameters that apply directly to the materials and processes defined in the hypothesis.
Design a Modular Experimental Workflow:
Organize the entire experimental process into standard, modular phases. Use generic phase titles rather than operation-specific ones. For example:
Phase 1: Precursor System Preparation
Phase 2: Core Structure Fabrication
Phase 3: Functionalization & Integration
Phase 4: Characterization & Performance Evaluation
Populate Module Content:
Under each modular phase, describe the specific operational steps, integrating the relevant parameters and details you selected earlier. Crucially, if the hypothesis involves key quantitative variables (e.g., mass fraction, molar concentration, temperature), you must propose a scientifically sound testing range or gradient and briefly justify the selection of this range.
Ensure Scientific Rigor:
Your protocol must include the following two critical sections:
Control Group Design: Design at least one critical control group to isolate variables and robustly test your core hypothesis. Explain how the control will be prepared and why it is essential.
Structure-Property Validation: Specify which characterization methods are needed to confirm the successful fabrication of the core structure (structural validation) and which tests will be used to evaluate the final performance (performance validation), thereby establishing a clear structure-property relationship.
Final Integration:
Integrate all the above components into a single, professionally formatted, logical, and reproducible research protocol.
