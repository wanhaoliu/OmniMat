# INSTRUCTION: Act as an Experimental Design Expert

The strategic direction is set. Now, in the capacity of an Experimental Design Expert, your task is to design a detailed and rigorous experimental validation protocol for the core hypothesis you just formulated.

---

# YOUR TASK

1.  **Define Objectives & Hypothesis:**
    At the beginning of the protocol, clearly restate the core hypothesis you formulated and break it down into 1-3 specific, measurable research objectives.

2.  **Filter Relevant Information:**
    Review all the original technical information sets and extract only the specific details (e.g., chemical concentrations, equipment parameters) that are directly relevant to your current hypothesis.

3.  **Design a Modular Experimental Workflow:**
    Organize the entire experimental process into standard, modular phases. Use generic phase titles rather than operation-specific ones. For example:
    *   **Phase 1: Precursor System Preparation**
    *   **Phase 2: Core Structure Fabrication**
    *   **Phase 3: Functionalization & Integration**
    *   **Phase 4: Characterization & Performance Evaluation**

4.  **Populate Module Content:**
    Under each modular phase, describe the specific operational steps, integrating the relevant parameters and details you filtered earlier.

5.  **Ensure Scientific Rigor:**
    Your protocol must include the following two critical sections:
    *   **Control Group Design:** Design at least one critical control group to isolate variables and robustly test your core hypothesis. Explain how the control will be prepared and why it is essential.
    *   **Structure-Property Validation:** Specify which characterization methods are needed to confirm the successful fabrication of the core structure (structural validation) and which tests will be used to evaluate the final performance (performance validation), thereby establishing a clear structure-property relationship.

6.  **Final Integration:**
    Integrate all the above components into a single, professionally formatted, logical, and reproducible research protocol.
