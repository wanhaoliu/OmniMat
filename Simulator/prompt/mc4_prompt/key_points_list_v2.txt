[Instruction]
Please act as a Data Normalization and Deduplication Expert. Your task is to process a list of candidate items and filter out any whose core component has already been evaluated, based on a comprehensive reference list. Your judgment must be based on identifying the fundamental entity, ignoring attached parameters. Your final output should be a list of these novel, core entities.

[Context]

1.  **Reference List of Evaluated Components:**
    {previously_evaluated_key_points}

2.  **Candidate List of Chemicals and Techniques to Process:**
    {candidate_chemicals_and_techniques}

[Your Task and Step-by-Step Logic]

Your response must be structured into two parts: a "Scratchpad" for your thought process and a "Final Output" with the result.

**Part 1: Scratchpad (Your Thought Process)**

Before providing the final list, you must first work through your reasoning here. For each item in the [Candidate List of Chemicals and Techniques to Process], perform and document the following steps:

*   **Step A: Identify the Core Entity.**
    *   From the candidate item string, you must extract its **base component** or **core entity**. This means stripping away any parameters, concentrations, adjectives, or other modifiers.
    *   *Generic Example of Thought Process:*
        *   Candidate: "A 50mg dose of Acetaminophen"
        *   Core Entity Identified: "Acetaminophen"
        *   Candidate: "The novel 'X-Pulse' Sonication method"
        *   Core Entity Identified: "Sonication"

*   **Step B: Perform Strict Comparison of the Core Entity.**
    *   Take the extracted **core entity** and check if it has a semantic equivalent in the [Reference List of Evaluated Components].
    *   **Strict Definition of "Same Item":** An item is a match ONLY IF the core entity is a **direct synonym, a common acronym, or a well-established alternative name** for an item in the reference list.
    *   *Generic Example of Thought Process:*
        *   Reference List contains: "Paracetamol"
        *   Core Entity: "Acetaminophen"
        *   Comparison Result: MATCH.
        *   Decision: Filter out "A 50mg dose of Acetaminophen".

    *   *Generic Example of Thought Process:*
        *   Reference List contains: "Stirring"
        *   Core Entity: "Sonication"
        *   Comparison Result: NO MATCH.
        *   Decision: Keep the core entity "Sonication".

*   **Step C: Compile the Final List of Core Entities.**
    *   After evaluating all candidates, compile a list of the unique **Core Entities** that you decided to KEEP. If multiple candidates resolve to the same novel core entity (e.g., "1-3 M solution of X" and "5 M solution of X"), that core entity ("X") should appear only once in the final list.

**Part 2: Final Output**

After completing your analysis in the scratchpad, provide the final, compiled list of unique core entities in the specified format below. This part should contain ONLY the delimited output block.
