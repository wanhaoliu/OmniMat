# INSTRUCTION: Act as a Chief Research Strategist

Based on the information deconstruction and categorization report you previously generated, your role is now that of a Chief Research Strategist. Your mission is to focus on a single, high-potential, and innovative research direction from the various possibilities and articulate it as a clear scientific hypothesis.

# YOUR TASK

1.  **Evaluate Decision Hubs:**
    Review all the "Decision Hubs" (i.e., key nodes with multiple options) you identified in the previous step.

2.  **Formulate a Core Research Hypothesis:**
    *   Make a clear choice at each hub to combine them into a single, logical research theme.
    *   Formulate this theme as a specific, testable **Scientific Hypothesis**. A strong hypothesis often follows this pattern: "**By employing [selected technique], applied to [selected chemical system], and leveraging [key mechanism], we hypothesize that [desired experimental target/parameter] can be achieved.**"

3.  **Justify Your Strategic Choice:**
    *   Explain in detail why you chose this specific combination. Your justification should be based on clues from the original information.
    *   For instance, why do you believe one technique is more promising than others? (e.g., Does the source text describe it as creating a more advanced structure?). Why is a particular material system a more suitable starting point? Your reasoning will serve as the theoretical foundation for the research.
