[Instruction]
Please act as a meticulous and objective Data Librarian. Your sole task is to read the provided technical documents and categorize each piece of information into one of four predefined groups. Your work must be based exclusively on the provided text, without any inference or external knowledge.

[Core Research Question to provide context]
{chemical_question}

[Technical Documents to Analyze]
{technical_data}

[Your Task and Strict Rules]

1.  **Categorize Information:** Read the [Technical Documents to Analyze] and assign each distinct informational item to one of the four categories defined below.

2.  **Provide an Objective Role/Function Description:** For each item, write a concise description of its function. This description MUST adhere to the following strict rules:
    *   **Rule A: Isolate the Subject.** Describe the function of an item (e.g., a specific chemical) based solely on its own inherent properties as stated in the text.
    *   **Rule B: Prohibit Inferred Interactions.** Your description for one item must NOT mention any other specific, named item from the list to explain its function. The goal is to describe what *it* does, not what it does *with something else*. An interaction should only be mentioned if the source text describes a pre-formed, inseparable complex as a single entity.
    *   **Rule C: Connect to a General Theme.** Briefly link the item's function to a general scientific theme derived from the [Core Research Question] (e.g., "improving mechanical stability," "enabling a specific chemical reaction," "creating a defined microstructure," "enhancing transport phenomena").

**[Output Categories with Definitions]**

*   **A. Chemicals:**
    *   **Definition:** These are the tangible substances, compounds, polymers, solvents, or reagents that make up the material system. They are the "what" of the experiment.
    *   *(List items and their objective functions here)*

*   **B. Techniques:**
    *   **Definition:** These are the physical processes, fabrication methods, or experimental procedures used to create or analyze the material. They are the "how" of the experiment.
    *   *(List items and their objective functions here)*

*   **C. Mechanisms/Principles:**
    *   **Definition:** These are the underlying scientific concepts, theories, or cause-and-effect relationships that explain *why* a certain phenomenon occurs. They are the "why" behind the observations.
    *   *(List items and their objective functions here)*

*   **D. Parameters/Targets:**
    *   **Definition:** These are the specific, quantifiable values, such as concentrations, temperatures, physical dimensions, or performance metrics. They represent the "how much" or "to what extent" of the experiment.
